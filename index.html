The hobby is a favorite activity that a person likes doing for recreational or entertainment purposes. In todayâ€™s busy life, all one does is come home from work, wake up again the next day and start working on. The loop keeps on repeating and repeating until the day comes when you get stressed to a level where you no longer wish you would work or earn. Making a name for yourself, for your career is all one wants and desires, but losing yourself along the way is no way of compromising with yourself or your work. Surrounded by many of my notable hobbies, going out, spending time on the computer, sports, reading, music, etc.
